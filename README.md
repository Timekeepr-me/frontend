# Timekeepr - Schedule Appointments, Set Your Own Rates, Get Paid

# What it does:

Timekeepr is a calendar app where you can create a calendar, book appointments with other users, and set rates for your time

Currently, this project is deployed on the Polygon Mumbai testnet. We currently support MetaMask and WalletConnect, to which you must connect to access all features.

Payments to others can be made with MATIC token, the native digital currency of the Polygon network. Payments get sent as a stream, thanks to SuperFluid integration.

If you do not charge fees or schedule appointments with users who charge, Timekeepr is free to use, with the exception of network fees. The price of gas might change at any time, so check PolygonScan for current prices. https://polygonscan.com/gastracker.

# Why Timekeepr?

Timekeepr began as a hackathon project for ETH Online. The original team started this project because they wanted a decentralized calendar app. This benefits both the individual user, as well as DAOs, and consultants/
